# 🚀 Connect Daily Worker

A MERN Stack based platform that connects **clients** with **daily workers** (plumber, electrician, painter, etc.) through real-time chat, job assignment, and rating system.

This project helps customers post their problems and allows nearby skilled workers to connect and solve them efficiently.

- Clients can post problems with images
- Workers can find jobs based on skills and location
- Both can communicate using real-time chat
